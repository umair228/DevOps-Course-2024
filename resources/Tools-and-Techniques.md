# DevOps Tools and Techniques

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of essential DevOps tools and techniques, helping you to automate and manage your development, deployment, and infrastructure processes efficiently.

---

## Version Control Systems
### Git
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously. It helps in tracking changes, collaborating on code, and managing different versions of a project.

---

## Containerization
### Docker
Docker is a platform that enables developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.

---

## Container Orchestration
### Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source platform designed to automate deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It helps manage containerized applications across a cluster of machines, providing mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and scaling.

---

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
### Jenkins
Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates continuous integration and continuous delivery. It automates the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, allowing for continuous delivery of software.

---

## Configuration Management
### Ansible
Ansible is an open-source tool for IT automation, configuration management, and provisioning. It allows you to automate the configuration of systems and the deployment of applications, making it easier to manage large-scale environments.

---

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
### Terraform
Terraform is an open-source tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a high-level configuration language. It enables you to manage infrastructure as code, making it easier to version, share, and reuse configurations.

---

## Monitoring and Logging
### Prometheus
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects and stores metrics as time series data, providing powerful querying capabilities and alerting.

### Grafana
Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It provides tools to query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics, logs, and traces, enabling you to create dashboards and alerts for your applications.
